# Ray-Tracer
This is the implementation of the Ray Tracer algorithm I wrote for CS 311 Computer Graphics, taught By Josh Davis. This project takes advantage of the Ray Tracer to implement other important concepts in graphics such as mirrors, shadows, and lighting. To run just download the folder and run `clang 740mainMeshes.c 040pixel.o -lglfw -framework OpenGL -framework Cocoa -framework IOKit` on Mac or `cc 740mainMeshes.c 040pixel.o -lglfw -lGL -lm -ldl` on Linux. Use W,A,S,D to move.
As the Ray Tracer was entirely written in C for the course it runs on the CPU, not on the GPU, which makes the code slow. There are a lot of objects in the screen and there are many effects and lightsources. So for a better performance I reccomend you run 740mainMeshes.c or an earlier main instead.

The files were originally written as homework exercises to be submitted before every class. The file naming convention of the class was quite strict, files which start with a larger number were written later in the term. Some files were the updated/upgraded version of homework assignments delivered earlier. For example, 080triangle is the same as 060triangle but with additional features (as it was done later). Files where the name start with main can be executed, and were used to test/debug the code throughout the term. Feel free to compile/run them.
